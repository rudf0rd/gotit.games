Stop buying games you already have.

## The Problem

With Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, EA Play, and a dozen other subscriptions, it's impossible to remember what you have access to. We've all bought a game on Steam only to realize it was sitting in Game Pass the whole time.

## The Solution

**gotit.games** tracks your gaming subscriptions and owned games in one place. Search for a game and instantly see if you already have access through any of your services.

## Features

- [ ] Connect Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation accounts
- [ ] Track active subscriptions (Game Pass, PS+ Extra, EA Play, etc.)
- [ ] Search across all your libraries at once
- [ ] Get alerts when games you own go on sale (why buy twice?)
- [ ] See which subscription has the game before you buy

## Status

Early development. Check back soon.
